              How’s your 2019 Honda Civic running? I wanted to check-in and make sure everything is going well and remind you that your lease ends on July 7th, 2022. It’s hard to believe you’ve been driving your Honda Civic since July of 2019! In any case, I’m here to help. And, at Ray Skillman Honda, we have a few options for you to consider.If you want me to take a look, I can see if you’re eligible to opt-out of your lease early so that we can start the process of leasing or buying another car today.If you’re still enjoying your 2019 Honda Civic, we can work together for you to buy it out and make it yours.
                Finally, if you’re interested in leasing or buying a new vehicle once your lease is up on July 7, 2022, let’s schedule an appointment for you to test drive some of the great new or used cars we have on the lot.Feel free to reply to this email with your preference, or you can give me a call at (317) 828-9875.
